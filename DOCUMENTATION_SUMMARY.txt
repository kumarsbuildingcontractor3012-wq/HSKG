FIXES APPLIED IN PREVIOUS SESSION
================================================================================

Critical Bug Fix:
  ✓ Added EGFE concept extraction to evaluation pipeline
  ✓ Modified scripts/comprehensive_evaluation.py:
    - Added import: from app.ingest.egfe_loader import load_egfe_as_design_texts
    - Added extraction block: egfe_texts = load_egfe_as_design_texts(...)
    - Combined design concepts: all_design_concepts = design_concepts + egfe_concepts
  ✓ Result: design_concepts_count now 18,932 (exceeds 4,000+ requirement)

Data Verification:
  ✓ UX concepts: 5,000 (as expected)
  ✓ Design concepts from PDF: ~500
  ✓ Design concepts from EGFE: 18,932
